# Introduction

## Course Overview

這門課主要是關於：

- Python 程式語言
- Python 內建型別（build-in types）
- Python 標準函式庫（standard library）

請確保使用 Python 3.6 以上的版本。

## The Zen of Python

在開始這門課之前，我們有必要先了解 Python 這門程式語言。作為 Python 的主要貢獻者之一，軟體工程師 Tim Peters 在 1999 年的郵件列表中發表了所謂的《Python 之禪（The Zen of Python）》，一共包含了十九條影響 Python 程式語言設計的編寫原則，並被收錄於 [PEP 20](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)。

在 Python 的交互式介面中，我們可輸入 `import this` 顯示其內容：

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
