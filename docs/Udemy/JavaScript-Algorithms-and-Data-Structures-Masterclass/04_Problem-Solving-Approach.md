# Problem Solving Approach

在現實生活中，我們需要藉由撰寫程式來完成特定任務，而所謂的演算法（Algorithms）可以視為完成特定任務的一系列步驟或過程。那麼該怎麼提昇我們解決問題的能力呢？這裡提出了兩個主要的建議：

- 設計一套針對問題求解的計畫
- 熟悉常見問題的求解套路

關於面對問題時的求解計畫，可以參考 George Polya 所撰寫的 [《How To Solve It》](https://www.amazon.com/How-Solve-Mathematical-Princeton-Science/dp/069111966X) 一書。根據該書的內容可以總結出以下策略：

1. Understand the Problem
2. Explore Concrete Examples
3. Break it down
4. Solve and Simplify
5. Look Back and Refactor

## Understand the Problem

- Can I restate the problem in my own words?
- What are the inputs that go into the problem?
- What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
- Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem? (You may not be ablue to answer this question until you set about solving the problem. That's Okay; it's still worth considering the question at this early stage.)
- How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

## Explore Examples

- Start with simple examples
- Progress to more complex examples
- Explore Examples with Empty Inputs
- Explore Examples with Invalid Inputs

## Break it Down

## Solve and Simplify

## Look Back and Refactor
