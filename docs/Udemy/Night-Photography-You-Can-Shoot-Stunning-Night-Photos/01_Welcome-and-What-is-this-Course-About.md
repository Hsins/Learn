## [Lecture] Our 10 Night Photography Commandments

關於夜間攝影（Night Photography）的十誡：

- **使用腳架（Use a Tripod）**：To make sure your long exposure photos are completely sharp.
- **使用電子快門線（Bring a Shutter Release Remote）**：To shoot long exposures at custom lengths, longer than 30 seconds.
- **尋找前景（Find Foreground）**：After getting shots of just the stars, tilt down and find a ‘subject’ to put in your foreground.
- **避免光害（Get Away from Light Pollution）**：Even if you can’t see it with your human eyes, a long exposure will capture light pollution from the dimmest of light sources. To see the most stars, you’ll have to get far away from the city lights.
- **注意月亮（Pay Attention to the Moon）**：The moon can also prevent you and your camera from seeing as many stars as possible. Check to see when the moon will be high in the sky (and what moon phase it is).
- **環顧四週（Turn Around）**：Try snapping photos in all directions. The light pollution your camera captures might actually result in a really cool photo.
- **使用手動對焦（Use Manual Focus）**：Most cameras will have a hard time auto-focusing to the sky or a foreground object. Adjust focus manually or if your camera can use auto-focus to focus on a foreground object, switch to manual mode before actually snapping the photo. This will ensure that the focus doesn’t change after it is set.
- **保存拍攝影像為 RAW 檔（Shoot in RAW）**：Shooting in RAW mode will give you the most editing room. They will capture more colors than a JPEG file.
- **攜帶閃光燈（Bring a Flashlight）**：A flashlight can do a few things: make sure you don’t trip over anything in the dark night; help you see the buttons and dials of your camera; help you get manual focus on a foreground object by shining the light on it before snapping your photo.
- **練習再練習（Practice, Practice, Practice）**：Every situation is going to be different. Get out there, test your settings, and have fun with it!
