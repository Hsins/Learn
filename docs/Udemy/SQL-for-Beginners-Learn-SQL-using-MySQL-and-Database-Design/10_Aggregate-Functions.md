# Aggregate Functions

## [Lecture] What is Aggregate Functions

Aggregate Functions perform a calculations on data within a column and returns one result row. We can use `GROUP BY` clauses to group the results by columns. Besides, we can use a `HAVING` clause in a similar way to a `WHERE` clause in a `SELECT` statement to filter the results set. There are the useful aggregate functions below:

- `COUNT`
- `SUM`
- `MIN`
- `MAX`
- `AVERAGE`
