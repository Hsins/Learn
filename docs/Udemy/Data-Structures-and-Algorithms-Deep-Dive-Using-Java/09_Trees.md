# Trees

## What are Trees?

樹結構

- Trees are Hierarchical data structure
- Node
- Child
- Parent
- Edge
- Leaf
- Subtree

- Every item in the tree is a node
- The node at the top of the tree is the root
- Every non-root node has one and only one parent
- A leaf node has no children
- A singleton tree has only one node: the root

## Binary Search Trees

- Every node has 0, 1, or 2 children
- Children are referred to as left child and right child
- Can perform insertions, deletions and retrievals in $O(\log{n})$ time
- The left child always has a smaller value than its parent
- The right child always has a larger value than its parent
