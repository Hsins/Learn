# Stacks

## Stacks

### Theory

- Abstract Data Type
- LIFO (Last in, First out)
- `push` adds an item as the top item on the stack
- `pop` removes the top item on the stack
- `peek` gets the top item on the stack without popping it
- Ideal backing Data Structure: Linked List

If you know the Maximum Number of items that will ever be on the stack, an array can be a good choice. If memory is tight, an array might be a good choice.
