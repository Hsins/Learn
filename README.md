# Introduction

I'm a really a big fan of Udemy, the most popular online learning and teaching platform. This is the repository I store my notes. All the note I took in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) `(.md)` format. I used to take and share my notes with [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/) but it rendering slowly when the files size get bigger.

> I am working in process to transfer all my notes from HackMD to this repository. There is a defect on GitHub markdown render engine that it doesn't support the MathJax or KaTeX to render math equations.
